# üè• Medical Insurance Churn Prediction

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict potential customer churn in the medical insurance domain, using the [Medical Cost Personal Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance). We consider **high medical charges** as a proxy for **churn risk**, assuming that users with high costs may be at greater risk of canceling or lapsing their insurance coverage.

## üìå Problem Statement

**Goal:** Predict whether a customer is at risk of churning (proxy: `charges` > median) based on features like age, BMI, smoking status, region, etc.

---

## üß† Project Workflow

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution of key features (`age`, `bmi`, `charges`, etc.)
- Correlation heatmap to understand relationships
- Visualization by smoker, region, children, and churn status

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Categorical encoding using One-Hot Encoding
- BMI binning (underweight, healthy, overweight, obese)
- Created new binary target variable: `churn_risk` = 1 if charges > median
- Created many visualisations

### 3. Model Building
Tried out and tuned the following classification models:
- ‚úÖ Logistic Regression
- ‚úÖ Random Forest Classifier
- ‚úÖ XGBoost Classifier

### 4. Evaluation
Metrics used:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC AUC Curve

## üîç Final Conclusion

- **Smoking status** and **BMI** are top predictors of high insurance charges.
- The churn risk model can help insurance companies **proactively retain customers** by identifying high-risk profiles.
- Logistic Regression is interpretable, but **RandomForestt** provides the best performance.
- Further improvements could include adding more behavioral or historical features.
